Topic-wise Assignment :
------------------------------------------- 
A. Loops :
 A1. Write a program in C++ to find the first 10 natural numbers.
Sample output:
The natural numbers are:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

 A2. Write a program in C++ to display n terms of natural numbers and their sum.
Sample Output:
Input a number of terms: 7
The natural numbers upto 7th terms are:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
The sum of the natural numbers is: 28

 A3. Write a program in C++ to calculate the series (1) + (1+2) + (1+2+3) + (1+2+3+4) + ... + (1+2+3+4+...+n).
Sample Output:
Input the value for nth term: 5
1 = 1
1+2 = 3
1+2+3 = 6
1+2+3+4 = 10
1+2+3+4+5 = 15
The sum of the above series is: 35

 A4. Write a C++ program that displays the pattern like a pyramid using asterisks, with odd numbers in each row.
Sample Output:
 
                                                     
 Input number of rows: 5                                               
                                                                       
    *                                                                  
   ***                                                                 
  *****

 A5. Write a C++ program with following options:
	a. Find a number is Shakuntala Devi's number or not. Ex: 145
	b. Find range of Shakuntala Devi's numbers. Ex: between 1 to 1000 is : 1, 2, 145 
-------------------------------------------
B. Strings :

B1. Write a C++ program to change every letter in a given string with the letter following it in the alphabet (i.e. a becomes b, p becomes q, z becomes a).
Example:
Sample Input: w3resource
Sample Output: x3sftpvsdf

B2. Write a C++ program to check if a given string is a Palindrome or not.
A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam, racecar.
Example:
Sample Input: madam
Sample Output: True


-------------------------------------------
C. Basic C++ Object-Oriented Programming :
 C1. Write a C++ program to create a class called Person that has private member variables for name, age and country. Implement member functions to set and get the values of these variables.

 C2. Write a C++ program to implement a class called BankAccount that has private member variables for account number and balance. Include member functions to deposit and withdraw money from the account.







-------------------------------------------
D. Data-structures using C++:
 D1. Write a C++ program to implement a stack using an array with push and pop operations. Check if the stack is full.
Test Data:
MAX_SIZE of the array: 5
Insert some elements onto the stack:
Stack elements: 1 2 5 6 9
Is the stack full? 1
Remove an element from the stack! 1
Stack elements: 2 5 6 9
Is the stack full? 0

 D2.  Write a C++ program to find the mean, variance and standard deviation of all elements of a queue.

 D3. Implement linked list working like Queue.
 D4. Implement linked list working like Stack.
 D5. Add two hugh positive numbers using  linked list.
 D6. Add two hugh positive numbers using  linked list.

-------------------------------------------
E. Operator-Overloading :
 E1. Support following operators to be overloaded for Complex numbers :
	a. Subtraction.
	b. Multiplication.
	c. pre and post decrement.
	d. Display Complex number. Hint: cout << obj.
